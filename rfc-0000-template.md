# Drawbacks

Why should this not be added.

# Rationale and alternatives

- Are there alternative ways to solve this
- Could this be done with existing features or existing solutions

# Prior art

This should include both good and bad outlooks on the the proposal, this could include how other platforms, software and hardware solve similar issues if relevent or how any existing proposals have tried to solve the same problem.

# Unresolved questions

- Are there any parts which are not yet designed or you believe need further discussion
